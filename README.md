# 👋 Hi there, I'm Ritunjai Khuteta

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm an enthusiastic learner diving deep into the world of **Data Structures & Algorithms**, **C++ development**, and **system-level programming**. Whether it's building voting systems or solving complex algorithmic challenges, I enjoy turning logic into code.

## 💻 What I Do
- 🧠 Currently learning **DSA from scratch** to master competitive programming.
- 🧾 I write C++ applications — from simple console apps to performance-optimized programs.
- 📚 I explore technical concepts thoroughly and love to understand how things work under the hood.
- 🧪 I test, debug, and refactor code to ensure clarity and efficiency.

## 🎯 Interests
- 🕹️ Gaming tech & performance (especially hunting for the best laptops under budget!)
- 🧩 Algorithmic thinking & problem solving
- 📱 BGMI sensitivity tweaks and performance setups
- 📷 Occasionally editing/compressing images for size-sensitive projects
- 🧠 Curious about how AI, foundation models, and generative systems function

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
```cpp
Languages:   C++, Python (beginner), Markdown
Tools:       VS Code, GCC/G++, Git & GitHub
Learning:    DSA, basic web dev (soon), system design (later)## Hi there 👋
